## Configuration Requirements

For the Google authentication to work in any environment, the following environment variables are needed:

```
# Either format works
AUTH_GOOGLE_ID=your-google-client-id
AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET=your-google-client-secret

# Or
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret

# Auth secret
AUTH_SECRET=your-secret-here
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-here

# URL configuration
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3001 # Or your deployment URL
```

## Testing Authentication

To test the Google authentication:

1. Ensure the Google OAuth credentials are properly set up in the Google Developer Console
2. Configure the authorized redirect URIs to include your development URL
3. Set the correct environment variables
4. Start the application and navigate to the sign-in page
5. Click the "Continue with Google" button
6. Complete the OAuth flow in the Google popup
7. Verify successful sign-in and redirection to the home page

## Troubleshooting

Common issues:
- Invalid redirect URI: Make sure the callback URL is registered in Google console
- Missing environment variables: Check all required variables are set
- CORS issues: Ensure the proper domains are configured
