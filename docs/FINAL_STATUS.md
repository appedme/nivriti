# ‚úÖ All Issues Resolved - Final Status

## üéâ Success! All Reported Issues Have Been Fixed

### Issue 1: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Navbar showing "Sign in" after login
**Problem**: After Google authentication, the navbar was still showing "Sign in" and "Get Started" buttons instead of the user avatar.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Updated main page (`src/app/page.js`) to use server-side authentication
- Modified Layout component to properly handle session state with `useSession()` hook
- Added fallback logic to detect user authentication state
- Added proper sign-out functionality to Header dropdown

**Result**: ‚úÖ Navbar now correctly shows user avatar when logged in and sign-in buttons when logged out.

### Issue 2: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - useCreateStory export error
**Problem**: `useCreateStory` hook was imported but not exported from `useApi.js`, causing build errors.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added `useCreateStory()` hook export that wraps the createStory function from useStoryMutation
- Added `useUpdateStory()` hook export that wraps the updateStory function from useStoryMutation
- Provided simpler interfaces for components that only need one operation

**Result**: ‚úÖ WriteStory component and other components can now import and use these hooks without errors.

### Bonus Fix: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Dynamic route conflicts
**Problem**: Next.js was throwing routing errors due to conflicting `[id]` and `[storyId]` folders.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Consolidated all story API routes under the `[id]` folder structure
- Moved chapter routes to the correct location: `src/app/api/stories/[id]/chapters/[chapterId]/`
- Removed duplicate `[storyId]` folder structure

**Result**: ‚úÖ Development server now starts without routing conflicts.
