# Authentication Changes

## Overview

The authentication system for Nivriti has been simplified to use Google authentication only. The credential-based login has been removed to streamline the login flow and provide a more consistent user experience.

## Changes Made

1. **Sign-in Page Simplification**
   - Removed email/password form fields
   - Made Google authentication the only login option
   - Updated UI to be more streamlined with a single-button approach
   - Improved loading states and user feedback during authentication

2. **Authentication Configuration**
   - The NextAuth configuration already used only Google provider
   - No changes were needed to the core authentication setup

3. **AuthButton Component Update**
   - Updated to ensure proper callback URLs
   - Improved sign-in and sign-out flow

## Benefits

- **Simplified User Experience**: Users only need to remember their Google account credentials
- **Enhanced Security**: Leveraging Google's security features instead of managing passwords
- **Faster Onboarding**: One-click sign-in reduces friction for new users
- **Reduced Maintenance**: No need to handle password resets, account recovery, etc.

## Further Enhancements

Potential future authentication improvements:
- Add additional OAuth providers if needed (GitHub, Twitter, etc.)
- Implement role-based access control for admin features
- Add enhanced user profile management
