# Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Navigation Bar Authentication Issue
**Problem**: After logging in, the navbar was still showing "Sign in" and "Get Started" buttons instead of the user avatar.

**Root Cause**: The main page (`src/app/page.js`) was not properly getting the user session, and the Layout component wasn't handling authentication state correctly.

**Solution**:
- Updated `src/app/page.js` to use server-side authentication with `auth()` from NextAuth
- Modified `src/components/layout/Layout.js` to be a client component that uses `useSession()` hook
- Added fallback logic to use session data when no user prop is provided
- Added proper sign-out functionality to the Header component

### 2. Missing API Hook Export Error
**Problem**: `useCreateStory` and `useUpdateStory` hooks were being imported but not exported from `useApi.js`, causing a build error.

**Root Cause**: The hooks were defined as part of `useStoryMutation` but individual convenience hooks were missing.

**Solution**:
- Added `useCreateStory()` hook that returns the createStory function from useStoryMutation
- Added `useUpdateStory()` hook that returns the updateStory function from useStoryMutation
- These provide simpler interfaces for components that only need one operation

### 3. Dynamic Route Conflict
**Problem**: Next.js was throwing an error about conflicting dynamic route names (`'id' !== 'storyId'`).

**Root Cause**: There were two folders in the API routes: `[id]` and `[storyId]` causing route conflicts.

**Solution**:
- Consolidated all story-related API routes under the `[id]` folder
- Moved the `[chapterId]` folder from the duplicate structure to the correct location
- Removed the duplicate `[storyId]` folder structure

## Files Modified

### Core Authentication Files
- `src/app/page.js` - Added server-side auth
- `src/components/layout/Layout.js` - Made client component with useSession
- `src/components/layout/Header.js` - Added signOut functionality

### API Hooks
- `src/hooks/useApi.js` - Added useCreateStory and useUpdateStory exports

### Routing Structure
- Moved `src/app/api/stories/[storyId]/chapters/[chapterId]/` to `src/app/api/stories/[id]/chapters/[chapterId]/`
- Removed duplicate `src/app/api/stories/[storyId]/` folder

## Testing Results

✅ **Authentication Flow**: 
- User session properly detected and displayed in navbar
- Sign-in redirects to Google OAuth correctly
- Sign-out functionality works from user dropdown

✅ **API Hooks**: 
- useCreateStory and useUpdateStory can be imported without errors
- Story creation and editing should work properly

✅ **Development Server**: 
- No more dynamic route conflicts
- Server starts successfully without errors

## Verification Steps

1. **Test Authentication**:
   - Navigate to the home page
   - Check that navbar shows "Sign in" when logged out
   - Click "Sign in" and complete Google OAuth flow
   - Verify navbar shows user avatar when logged in
   - Test sign-out from user dropdown

2. **Test API Hooks**:
   - Navigate to `/write` page
   - Verify page loads without import errors
   - Test creating a new story
   - Test editing an existing story

3. **Test Routing**:
   - Verify development server starts without route conflicts
   - Test story-related API endpoints work correctly

## Future Improvements

- Add error boundaries for better error handling
- Implement loading states during authentication
- Add user session persistence options
- Consider adding additional OAuth providers if needed
